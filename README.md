## Why This Demo? — The Payer & Provider Pain Points

Healthcare payers and providers face compounding operational challenges that erode revenue, increase regulatory risk, and compromise patient outcomes. This demo addresses **six critical pain points** that cost the U.S. healthcare system billions annually:

### 1. Claim Denials Are Draining Revenue

> **Industry average denial rate: 10-15%** — costing a mid-size health system **$4.2M+ per year** in rework, appeals, and lost revenue.

Payers deny claims for preventable reasons: missing documentation (23%), invalid codes (18%), eligibility issues (14%), and prior authorization gaps. Most organizations lack real-time visibility into *which* claims are at risk *before* submission. This demo builds a **denial risk scoring model** that flags high-risk claims proactively, surfaces root causes by payer, and tracks appeal success rates — turning reactive denial management into a predictive workflow.

### 2. Readmissions Drive CMS Penalties

> **CMS Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP)** penalizes hospitals **up to 3% of total Medicare reimbursement** — for a $450M system, that's **$13.5M at stake**.

30-day readmissions for CHF, COPD, pneumonia, AMI, and TKA/THA are tracked and penalized. Yet most providers lack integrated risk scoring that combines clinical data with social determinants. This demo computes **readmission risk scores** using encounter history, diagnosis complexity, and SDOH factors (food deserts, housing instability, transportation barriers), enabling targeted discharge planning before patients leave the facility.

### 3. Medication Non-Adherence Sinks Star Ratings

> **CMS Star Ratings** triple-weight medication adherence measures (diabetes, RAS antagonists, statins) — making PDC scores the **single largest driver** of plan quality ratings and bonus payments.

Plans with 4+ stars receive significant CMS bonus payments, but adherence gaps are invisible without pharmacy claims integration. This demo calculates **Proportion of Days Covered (PDC)** per patient per drug class, identifies non-adherent members with chronic conditions, and maps adherence gaps to HEDIS measures — giving care managers actionable intervention lists.

### 4. Social Determinants Are Invisible in Clinical Workflows

> **80% of health outcomes** are driven by factors outside the clinic — yet SDOH data rarely appears alongside clinical data.

Zip-code-level poverty rates, food desert flags, transportation scores, housing instability rates, and social vulnerability indices exist in public datasets but aren't integrated into analytics platforms. This demo joins **SDOH data at the zip-code level** to every patient, encounter, and claim — enabling population health stratification, SDOH-informed readmission prevention, and health equity reporting.

### 5. Provider-Payer Contract Complexity Creates Revenue Leakage

> Health systems manage **12+ payer contracts** with different reimbursement rates, PA requirements, timely filing deadlines, and denial behaviors.

Without contract-level analytics, systems can't identify which payers underpay, which deny most frequently, or where network adequacy gaps exist. This demo models **payer-specific analytics** across 12 simulated payers with realistic contract rates, denial patterns, and formulary coverage — revealing collection rate variance and contract negotiation priorities.

### 6. Analytics Teams Can't Stand Up Environments Fast Enough

> Traditional healthcare analytics projects take **weeks to provision** — installing Python, configuring credentials, deploying infrastructure, debugging authentication.

This demo eliminates the entire setup burden. **One notebook, one click, fifteen minutes.** SQL-only analysts, clinical informaticists, and business users can explore a fully functional environment without touching a command line.

### What This Demo Proves

By combining all six dimensions — **claims + readmissions + adherence + SDOH + provider network + quality measures** — in a single Fabric workspace, this demo shows how Microsoft Fabric's unified platform (OneLake, Spark, Direct Lake, Copilot AI) can deliver:

- **Real-time denial risk dashboards** with root cause analysis and appeal tracking
- **Predictive readmission scoring** with SDOH-informed discharge planning
- **HEDIS-aligned medication adherence** monitoring with care gap closure
- **Natural language analytics** via Fabric Data Agent and Azure AI Foundry
- **Ontology-driven knowledge graphs** connecting patients → encounters → claims → providers → payers

All from a single workspace deployed in minutes.

## Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) — 3 Payer/Provider Use Cases

When `DEPLOY_RTI=True`, the launcher deploys a full RTI stack: **Eventhouse + KQL Database + 3 scoring notebooks** that address high-value payer/provider pain points where batch analytics fall short.

### Use Case 1: Claims Fraud Detection

> **$68B lost to healthcare fraud annually** (NHCAA). Most SIU teams investigate claims weeks after submission — by then, the money is gone.

**NB_RTI_Fraud_Detection** scores every claim in real-time using 4 rule-based signals:
- **Velocity burst** — Provider submits many claims within a 1-hour window (30 pts max)
- **Amount outlier** — Claim exceeds 3σ of provider's historical mean (25 pts max)
- **Geographic anomaly** — Patient location far from provider facility (25 pts max)
- **Upcoding** — Consistent use of highest E&M code 99215 (20 pts max)

Risk tiers: **CRITICAL** (≥50) → **HIGH** (≥30) → **MEDIUM** (≥15) → **LOW**

**Output:** `rti_fraud_scores` with lat/long for map visuals showing fraud hotspots.

### Use Case 2: Care Gap Closure at Point of Care

> **Payers spend $2-4 per member per month** on outreach for HEDIS gaps. The highest-value moment is when the patient is *already in front of a provider* — but the care team doesn't know about open gaps.

**NB_RTI_Care_Gap_Alerts** fires when an ADT (Admit/Discharge/Transfer) event arrives:
1. Joins the encounter with the patient's **8 HEDIS measures** (CDC, COL, BCS, SPC, CBP, SPD, OMW, PPC)
2. Checks for open care gaps and ranks by priority (CRITICAL if diabetes/cancer gap >180 days)
3. Generates **human-readable alerts** for the care team at the bedside

**Output:** `rti_care_gap_alerts` with facility lat/long for map visuals showing which facilities have the most gap closure opportunities.

### Use Case 3: High-Cost Member Trajectory

> **5% of members drive 50% of total healthcare costs.** Early identification of members *trending toward* high-cost status enables care management intervention before catastrophic events.

**NB_RTI_HighCost_Trajectory** computes rolling windows over claims and encounters:
- **30-day and 90-day rolling spend** — flags members exceeding $15K/30d or $40K/90d
- **ED superutilizer detection** — ≥3 emergency visits in 30 days
- **Readmission tracking** — multiple admits within 30 days
- **Cost trend** — ACCELERATING / RISING / STABLE / DECLINING

Risk tiers: **CRITICAL** (high spend + frequent ED) → **HIGH** (high spend) → **MEDIUM** (ED/readmit/accelerating) → **LOW**

**Output:** `rti_highcost_alerts` with lat/long for map visuals showing cost hotspots.

### RTI Sample Questions — Data Agent

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 31 | Which providers have the highest fraud scores? Show the top 10 with their fraud flags and total flagged claim amounts. |
| 32 | How many claims are in each fraud risk tier (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)? |
| 33 | Which facilities have the most open care gap alerts? Show the breakdown by HEDIS measure. |
| 34 | How many patients have CRITICAL care gap alerts? Which measures are most overdue? |
| 35 | Which members are on an accelerating cost trajectory? Show their 30-day spend, ED visits, and readmission status. |
| 36 | What is the total flagged claim amount for claims with geographic anomaly fraud patterns? |
| 37 | Show me the overlap between high-cost members and those with open care gaps. |

### RTI Data Tables

| Table | Description | Rows (Default) |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `rti_claims_events` | Simulated claim submissions with fraud patterns | ~500 |
| `rti_adt_events` | ADT events (admit/discharge/transfer) | ~250 |
| `rti_rx_events` | Prescription fill events | ~166 |
| `rti_fraud_scores` | Scored claims with risk tiers and fraud flags | ~500 |
| `rti_care_gap_alerts` | Point-of-care gap closure alerts | varies |
| `rti_highcost_alerts` | Members on escalating cost trajectory | varies |

### Switching to Live Streaming

By default, the RTI notebooks run in **batch mode** (single batch → Delta tables). To enable continuous streaming:

1. The launcher already deployed the **Eventhouse** and **KQL Database** as Git artifacts
2. **NB_RTI_Setup_Eventhouse** discovers them, creates 6 KQL tables with streaming ingestion policies, and creates the **Eventstream** with a **Custom Endpoint** source
3. The notebook prints the Custom Endpoint **connection string** and **event hub name**
4. Open **NB_RTI_Event_Simulator** → set `MODE = "stream"`, paste `EVENTSTREAM_CONN_STR` and `EVENTHUB_NAME`
5. Run — events flow continuously every 5 seconds through Eventstream → KQL DB

> **Note:** If the connection string wasn't printed by the setup notebook, open the Eventstream in the Fabric portal, click the Custom Endpoint source node, and copy the values from the details panel.

### Sample Questions — Azure AI Foundry Agent

If you've set up the optional **Foundry Orchestrator Agent** (see [FOUNDRY_IQ_SETUP_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/kwamesefah_microsoft/Healthcare-Data-Analytics-Repo/blob/main/FabricDemoHLS/FOUNDRY_IQ_SETUP_GUIDE.md)), it combines the Data Agent's live numbers with 21 clinical knowledge documents and web search. It provides richer, cited responses with clinical context. Copy-paste these:

#### Clinical Decision Support
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | Which patients are at highest risk for readmission and what clinical interventions does the readmission prevention protocol recommend for each risk tier? |
| 2 | For our diabetic patients who are non-adherent to Metformin, what does the ADA stepwise therapy guideline recommend as next steps? |
| 3 | What CHF patients have a readmission risk score above 0.7 and what does the GDMT protocol recommend for their discharge planning? |
| 4 | Show me COPD patients who were readmitted within 30 days. What does the GOLD staging guideline say about their exacerbation management? |

#### Denial Management with Policy Context
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 5 | What are our top denial reasons and what does the Root Cause Analysis Framework say about corrective actions for each? |
| 6 | For claims denied due to missing prior authorization, what are the PA requirements by payer and what is the appeal success rate? |
| 7 | Show me the highest-value denied claims from BlueCross. What does the Appeal Process Guide recommend for Level 1 appeals? |
| 8 | What does the Clean Claim Checklist say we should verify before submitting emergency encounter claims? |

#### Quality Measures & Star Ratings
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 9 | What is our current medication adherence rate for the CMS Star triple-weighted measures (diabetes, RAS, statins) and how far are we from the 4-star cut point? |
| 10 | Based on our HEDIS measures data, which quality gaps should we prioritize to improve our Star Rating? |
| 11 | What is our estimated HRRP penalty exposure based on current readmission rates for CHF and COPD? Compare to the CMS penalty threshold. |

#### Population Health & SDOH
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 12 | For patients in food desert zip codes with high SVI, what SDOH-informed readmission prevention interventions does the protocol recommend? |
| 13 | Which patient populations should we target for care management outreach based on combined readmission risk, adherence gaps, and social vulnerability? |
| 14 | What does the clinical documentation standard require for E&M coding on high-complexity inpatient encounters, and are our providers meeting it? |

#### Formulary & Prescription Management
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 15 | Which patients are on non-formulary medications? What does the therapeutic interchange policy recommend as alternatives? |
| 16 | What are the step therapy requirements for our diabetic patients on GLP-1 agonists? Which payers require step therapy failure documentation? |
| 17 | Show me specialty drug authorization requirements for Insulin Glargine by payer. Which patients might need reauthorization soon? |

#### Provider Network & Contracts
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 18 | Which payers have the lowest reimbursement rates for our highest-volume CPT codes? What does the contract guide say about negotiation priorities? |
| 19 | Do we have any network adequacy gaps based on CMS time/distance standards? Which specialties are underserved? |
| 20 | Compare our collection rates against contracted rates by payer. Where are we seeing the most revenue leakage? |

### Create the Ontology & Graph Model (Manual — ~10 min)

The ontology **cannot** be fully deployed via API — the Fabric Preview API creates unlinked ontology and graph items, which breaks Fabric IQ graph traversal and Copilot integration. You must create it from the semantic model in the UI.

Follow the step-by-step guide: **[ONTOLOGY_GRAPH_SETUP_GUIDE.md](ONTOLOGY_GRAPH_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

Quick summary:
1. **New item** → Ontology → from semantic model `HealthcareDemoHLS`
2. **Delete** 3 unwanted entities (dim_date, agg_medication_adherence, agg_readmission_by_date)
3. **Rename** 10 entities (e.g., dim_patient → Patient) using the guide's master table
4. **Set** source keys and display names per the guide
5. **Replace** auto-generated relationships with 15 curated ones from the guide
6. **Build the graph** (Graph tab → Build a graph → select all)

The guide includes master configuration tables for all entities, relationships, and full property references.

### Run Incremental Loads
To simulate daily operational data arriving:

1. Open **NB_Generate_Incremental_Data** → Run All  
   *(generates ~50 new encounters, claims, prescriptions, diagnoses for today)*
2. Open **PL_Healthcare_Master** → Run with parameter `load_mode=incremental`

Repeat daily to build up a realistic data history.

## Configuration Options

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Workspace is not empty" | Create a new empty workspace, or set `allow_non_empty_workspace=True` in the config cell |
| Pipeline fails | Open PL_Healthcare_Master → check activity run details. Common cause: lakehouse tables not yet created |
| Semantic model shows no data | Run the pipeline first — it populates Gold lakehouse tables that the model reads |
| Data Agent returns generic answers | Ensure `healthcare_knowledge/` docs were uploaded to `lh_gold_curated/Files/` |
| Ontology not auto-deployed | By design — must be created in the UI from the semantic model. Follow [ONTOLOGY_GRAPH_SETUP_GUIDE.md](ONTOLOGY_GRAPH_SETUP_GUIDE.md) |
| `fabric-launcher` install fails | Ensure your Fabric capacity supports Python package installation |
