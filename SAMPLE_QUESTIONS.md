## Azure AI Foundry Agent Questions

If you've set up the optional **Foundry Orchestrator Agent** (see [FOUNDRY_IQ_SETUP_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/kwamesefah_microsoft/Healthcare-Data-Analytics-Repo/blob/main/FabricDemoHLS/FOUNDRY_IQ_SETUP_GUIDE.md)), it combines the Data Agent's live numbers with 21 clinical knowledge documents and web search. It provides richer, cited responses with clinical context.
